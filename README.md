An non-Pythonic implementation of gSpan

This is based off of the gSpan implementaiton found here:

https://github.com/Jokeren/DataMining-gSpan

This is not how you would write gspan in python. It is
some scratch code I'm writing as an experiment to help me
understand gspan better to write a C implementation.
